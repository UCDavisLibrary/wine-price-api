# Example data

This example data can be used to warm up a development machine.  Note that
the database is still warmed up with the template and the seed.json file as in a
normal nodal setup.  This updates data via the API.

The data updated includes two example catalogs, and some example markup.  There
is a Makefile to run.  You might need to modify some of the parameters.

``` bash
make upload
```
